          <p>
            Hello, I am Ryan Brooks, MA, LLP, a cancer counseling specialist and
            psychotherapist. Although my practice specializes in cancer-focused
            counseling, I have extensive experience and training working with
            grief, depression, chronic illness, PTSD, trauma and anxiety.
          </p>
          <p>
            My training began with a BSc of Psychology at the University of
            Michigan, completing all Pre-Med requirements. In lieu of pursuing
            medicine, my travels led me to the Republic of Ireland, where I
            resettled and received my Master's in Counseling and Psychotherapy
            at Dublin City University, with advanced training in couples and
            relationship therapy. I remained in Ireland for over ten years,
            working in private practice providing individual and relationship
            counseling. Upon my return to the U.S., I obtained Michigan
            licensure and a MA in Counseling Psychology from Wayne State
            University, with advanced training in marriage and family therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work to make my therapy integrative with a person-centered core,
            offering a warm, non-judgmental, and safe space where personal
            exploration of your concerns can begin. I bring my training and
            experience in multiple theoretical approaches to therapy including
            psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral (CBT), existential, and
            humanistic. This allows me to work with clients with a broad
            spectrum of concerns while offering the most effective,
            research-based interventions and support. My approach to
            relationship therapy incorporates strategies primarily from John
            Gottman, emotion-focused therapy, and IMAGO. These approaches
            provide couples with the necessary tools to improve communication,
            reduce conflict and achieve the connection and intimacy they seek.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not sitting in my therapist role, I enjoy keynote speaking
            to licensed mental health workers on the clinical considerations of
            psycho-oncology and cancer support non-profit organizations on the
            importance of self-care. I also enjoy coaching wrestling at the
            local high school and doing as much yoga, gardening and movie
            watching as time will allow.
