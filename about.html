          <p>
            Thank you for your interest! My training began at University of
            Michigan, receiving a BSc of Psychology and completing all Pre-Med
            requirements. In lieu of pursuing medicine, travels led me to the
            Republic of Ireland where I resettled and received my Master's
            equivalent in Counseling and Psychotherapy at Dublin City
            University, with advanced training in couples and relationship
            therapy. There I remained for 10+ years in total, working in private
            practice providing individual and relationship counseling. Upon
            repatriation to the U.S. I obtained Michigan licensure and a MA in
            Counseling Psychology from Wayne State University, with advanced
            training in marriage and family therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            My therapy is integrative with a person-centered core. In an effort
            to provide an ideal therapeutic environment I offer a warm,
            non-judgmental, and safe place wherein personal exploration of your
            concerns can begin. Being integrative means I have training and
            experience in multiple theoretical approaches to therapy including
            psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral (CBT), existential, and
            humanistic. This allows me to work with clients presenting with a
            broad spectrum of concerns while offering them the most effective,
            research-based interventions and support. My approach to
            relationship therapy incorporates strategies primarily from John
            Gottman, emotion-focused therapy, and IMAGO. These approaches
            provide couples with the necessary tools to improve communication,
            reduce conflict and achieve the connection and intimacy they seek.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy keynote speaking to licensed mental health workers on
            the clinical considerations of psycho-oncology as well as to cancer
            support non-profit organizations on the importance of self-care. On
            a personal note, I enjoy coaching wrestling at the local high school
            and doing as much yoga, gardening and movie watching as time will
            allow.
