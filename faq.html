              Not all therapists are knowledgeable in how to work with
              cancer-related distress or look for connections between current
              symptoms and a previous cancer experience, especially as some
              symptoms won't present until years later. So, don't be hesitant to
              shop around to find a therapist with which you feel most
              comfortable.

            Yes, these cancer-related trauma's take up residence in different
          parts of our minds and can lay dormant for years until we are ready to
          process them fully. Don't hesitate to talk about events that happened
          years ago as they often hold insight into the current distress. I find
          it essential to collaborate with my clients to ensure anything
          discussed in therapy happens when the client is ready and at their
          pace.

    <div class="answer">
      <p>Psychotherapists and social workers in cancer-focused counseling often
        work closely with psychiatrists that can prescribe medication.
        However, results can usually be achieved without medication and their
        use is more typically in extreme circumstances. Ask your therapist to
        be upfront about whether they think medication is appropriate for your
        unique case. Although there are psychiatrists I refer to and whom I
        trust and have good working relationships, I do not believe medication
        is right for everyone.

  <div class="answer">
    <p>Yes, it is normal to be experiencing distress during and after a
      cancer experience, however, how we cope with those symptoms is a
      factor in our emotional and psychological recovery from cancer. It is
      recommended that you connect with a therapist to periodically meet
      with during treatment and recovery to help monitor your symptoms and
      offer coping skills along the way when needed. I always discuss with
      my clients what their needs are at that time and we schedule
      accordingly.

</div> <!--/question-->
<div class="answer">
  <p>Yes. As with most traumas we are unable to process the experience
    fully while still trying to survive, which results in the delay of the
    symptoms until months or years later. Furthermore, when the routine of
    treatment is complete individuals often find themselves discharged
    from their medical support team leading to feelings of isolation and
    the need for alternative sources of support. This is the period where
    many of my cancer-related referrals are received because patients are
    not taught how to cope with what they just went through.

<div class="answer">
  <p>Therapists don't look at coping methods as being right or wrong as
    this is different for everyone. The focus is more on the product of
    your way of coping (e.g., does it have unintended consequences?, Does
    it lead to more distress later on?). Don't interpret suggested
    alternatives to mean your way is wrong, but rather as there just might
    be another way that avoids undue distress down the road. Cancer
    counseling is much more than just talking about cancer too. More often
    than not, clients arrive in therapy wanting to discuss seemingly
    unrelated issues that have just become more difficult due to their
    cancer experience.</p>

<div class="answer">
  <p>Not asking for help during or after a cancer-related experience is
    like going white water rafting, falling overboard, and then not
    wanting to burden others with pulling you back in the boat. You need
    to ask for help, and doing so helps others in the process by allowing
    them the opportunity to help. I work with many clients that express
    the same sentiment. Knowing when it's time to ask for help is a
    strength, not a weakness.</p>
