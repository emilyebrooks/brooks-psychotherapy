Title:<br>
Brooks Psychotherapy Website

Description:<br>
Redesign and rebuild of Ryan Brooks' Psychotherapy website. Client created original website using website builder program,
but has never been happy with the website flow, style or professionalism. I designed the website using PhotoShop and
upon clients design approval built out the site using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Goal:<br>
Client desires a website that represents him both to clients as well as other healthcare professionals. The
site should welcome potential clients and make it easy for them to reach out with questions or to
book a session. The site should also provide insight to other professionals about Ryan's areas of expertise,
especially his focus on cancer patients, families/friends and care-providers, in order that they would feel
confident referring new clients to him directly.
