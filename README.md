Title:<br>
Brooks Psychotherapy Website 

Description:<br>
Redesign and rebuild of Ryan Brooks Psychotherapy website. Client created original website using website builder program, 
but has never been happy with his website flow, style or professionalism. I designed the website using PhotShop and 
upon clients approval am beginning to build out the site using HTML and CSS. (Javascript to come). 

Goal:<br>
Client would like a website that represents him both to clients as well as other healthcare professionals. The
site should welcome potential clients and make it easy for them to reach out to Ryan with questions or to 
book a session. It should also provide insight to other professionals about Ryan's areas of expertise, 
especially his focus on cancer patients, families/friends and care-providers, in order that they would feel
confident referring new clients to him directly.
