        <h2>Why Cancer Counseling?</h2>
      </section>
      <div class="page-text">
        <p>
          Cancer affects individuals and families in numerous ways and cancer
          counseling provides specialized support through the changes and impact
          of dealing with cancer. Some individuals may experience
          ‘cancer-related distress’ which in 2010 was identified as a sixth
          vital sign and defined as -
          <br />
          <span class="distress">
            "an unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological, social
            and/or spiritual nature which extends on a continuum from normal
            feelings of vulnerability, sadness and fears to disabling problems
            such as depression, anxiety, panic, social isolation and spiritual
            crisis." – NCCN, 2010</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Common indicators of cancer-related distress include but are not at
          all limited to depression, anxiety, anger outbursts, irritability,
          excessive worry, constant thinking, refusing to ask for help, chronic
          fatigue, issues of mortality, relationship conflict, social
          withdrawal, sleeping difficulties, and so on. While some level of
          distress is considered normal and expected, patients often report that
          they are reluctant to turn to family for support, leaving many feeling
          isolated and misunderstood. When this occurs, such individuals will
          benefit from cancer-focused counseling.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also the physical impact that cancer can have on the body,
          leading to issues with body image, sexual difficulties, reduced self-
          confidence, chronic pain, fatigue, and lifestyle adjustments, which
          all take a mental toll.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancer counseling approaches these in two ways, through
          <span class="emphasis">grief</span> and
          <span class="emphasis">acceptance</span>. Clients are encouraged to
          actively grieve the loss of their pre-cancer body, abilities,
          lifestyles, hopes, and/or expectations while simultaneously helping
          them to accept these changes. Time alone rarely serves to heal these
          emotional wounds, but therapy allows for quicker and more complete
          adjustment to the ‘new normal,’ as it’s commonly referred.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancer is also known to put significant strain on relationships. In
          addition to the increased fear and uncertainty, pre-existing issues
          within the relationship may become amplified, especially in areas of
          communication and conflict resolution. During treatment, parents and
          couples have to coordinate efforts and, in some cases, develop new
          roles within the relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Counseling during this process can help couples with communication and
          introduce skills to aid with any conflict that may arise. After cancer
          treatment, couples often struggle to adjust to the ways in which
          cancer 'changes' the individual. Counseling during this stage of
          cancer recovery and survivorship can help the client identify their
          new needs and communicate them while supporting the relationship as it
          also grows to accommodate and integrate these needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancer is also known to 'kick up the dust' on unresolved or past
          experiences clients have endured, making past traumas and unresolved
          grief more prevalent on their minds. This can bring with it
          significant emotional distress and render their coping skills less
          effective. Note that this, too, is normal and expected during a
          cancer-related experience. Unpleasant as they may be, these reawakened
          emotions are seen as a new opportunity to process the old experiences
          and obtain deeper levels of resolution and healing and counseling can
          help with this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever way you find cancer affecting you, your children, or a loved
          one, just know that specialized support is available.
